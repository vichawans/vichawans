# IGAC ECR conference 2023

The IGAC ECR conference is held virtually on Gathertown. 

I attended virtually, presenting a poster which can be [downloaded here](https://vichawans.github.io/assets/pdf/IGAC-ECR-poster-v1.1.pdf).

The work describes how atmospheric oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals affect sulfate aerosol formation.

## In a nutshell 
Sulfate aerosols play a significant role in shaping the climate
by inducing cooling by directly reflecting sunlight and also by
modifying cloud properties. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important
sulfate aerosol precursor with the largest sources coming from
anthropogenic activity. The oxidants that SO2 react with are
controlled by complex chemical processes.
In this work, we analysed the output from the UKâ€™s Earth
System Model1 from oxidation processes to radiative effect to
tease out the effects of oxidants on aerosol and climate.
