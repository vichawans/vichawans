Hi, I‚Äôm Vichawan but I also go by Print, currently working on a PhD project at the [Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/atm/index) on sulfate aerosol formation and its role in the climate. I am an aligned studen for the [Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risks (AI4ER)](Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risks (AI4ER))

I‚Äôm interested in 
* working with climate model data and understanding the climate and aerosol interactions. I have been working with the UKESM1 model outputs but plan to expand to other models in the future. 
* air quality and dealing with missing data in observations.


I also have some experience in working with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, specifically in compiling the source code and data visualisation. The main programming language I use is python for working with multi-dimensional array datasets. 

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more techniques to visualise and analyse climate model data. Machine learning for climate data analysis is another area I am keen on. 

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on research on sulfate aerosols and aerosol-cloud interaction.
